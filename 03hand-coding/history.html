        <h2>The History of Science Fiction</h2>

        <p>Some scholars assert that science fiction had its beginnings in ancient times, when the line between myth and
            fact was blurred. Written in the 2nd century CE by the satirist <strong>Lucian</strong> , <strong><i>A True
                    Story</i></strong> contains many themes and tropes characteristic of modern science fiction,
            including travel to other worlds, extraterrestrial lifeforms, interplanetary warfare, and artificial life.
            Some consider it the first science fiction novel. Some of the stories from <strong><i>The Arabian
                    Nights</i></strong>, along with the 10th-century <strong><em>Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</em></strong>
            and <strong>al-Nafis</strong> 's 13th-century <strong><i>Theologus Autodidactus</i></strong>, are also
            argued to contain elements of science fiction.</p>

        <p>Several books written during the Scientific Revolution and later the Age of Enlightenment are considered true
            works of science-fantasy. <strong>Francis Bacon</strong>'s <strong><i>New Atlantis</i></strong> (1627),
            <strong>Johannes Kepler</strong>'s<strong><i> Somnium </i></strong>(1634),<strong> Athanasius
                Kircher</strong>'s<strong><i> Itinerarium extaticum</i></strong> (1656),<strong> Cyrano de
                Bergerac</strong>'s<strong> Comical History of the States and Empires of the Moon</strong> (1657)
            and<strong> The States and Empires of the Sun</strong> (1662),<strong> Margaret
                Cavendish</strong>'s<strong><i> "The Blazing World"</i></strong> (1666),<strong> Jonathan
                Swift</strong>'s<strong><i> Gulliver's Travels</i></strong> (1726),<strong> Ludvig
                Holberg</strong>'s<strong><i> Nicolai Klimii Iter Subterraneum</i></strong> (1741) and<strong>
                Voltaire</strong>'s<strong><i> Micromégas</i></strong> (1752).</p>


        <p>Following the 17th-century development of the novel as a literary form,<strong> Mary
                Shelley</strong>'s<strong><i> Frankenstein</i></strong> (1818) and<strong><i> The Last Man</i></strong>
            (1826) helped define the form of the science fiction novel. Brian Aldiss has argued that Frankenstein was
            the first work of science fiction.<strong> Edgar Allan Poe</strong> wrote several stories considered to be
            science fiction, including<strong><i> "The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall"</i></strong> (1835),
            which featured a trip to the Moon.</p>

        <p><strong>Jules Verne</strong> was noted for his attention to detail and scientific accuracy, especially
            in<strong><i> Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas</i></strong> (1870). In 1887, the novel<strong><i> El
                    anacronópete</i></strong> by Spanish author<strong> Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau</strong> introduced the
            first time machine. An early French/Belgian science fiction writer was<strong> J.-H. Rosny aîné
            </strong>(1856–1940). Rosny's masterpiece is<strong><i> Les Navigateurs de l'Infini</i> (The Navigators of
                Infinity)</strong> (1925) in which the word astronaut, "astronautique", was used for the first time.</p>

        <p>Many critics consider<strong> H. G. Wells</strong> one of science fiction's most important authors, or even
            "the Shakespeare of science fiction". His works include<strong><i> The Time Machine
                </i>(1895)</strong>,<strong><i> The Island of Doctor Moreau</i> (1896)</strong>,<strong><i> The
                    Invisible Man</i> (1897)</strong>, and<strong><i> The War of the Worlds</i> (1898)</strong>. His
            science fiction imagined alien invasion, biological engineering, invisibility, and time travel. In his
            non-fiction futurologist works he predicted the advent of airplanes, military tanks, nuclear weapons,
            satellite television, space travel, and something resembling the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p><strong>Edgar Rice Burroughs</strong>'s<strong><i> A Princess of Mars</i></strong>, published in 1912, was
            the first of his three-decade-long planetary romance series of Barsoom novels, which were set on Mars and
            featured John Carter as the hero. These novels were predecessors to YA novels, and drew inspiration from
            European science fiction and American Western novels.</p>

        <p>In 1924,<strong><i> We</i></strong> by Russian writer<strong> Yevgeny Zamyatin</strong>, one of the first
            dystopian novels, was published. It describes a world of harmony and conformity within a united totalitarian
            state. It influenced the emergence of dystopia as a literary genre.</p>

        <p>In 1926,<strong> Hugo Gernsback</strong> published the first American science fiction magazine,<strong><i>
                    Amazing Stories</i></strong>. In its first issue he wrote:</p>

        <p>
            <i>By 'scientifiction' I mean the Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and Edgar Allan Poe type of story—a
                    charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision... Not only do these amazing
                    tales make tremendously interesting reading—they are always instructive. They supply knowledge... in
                    a very palatable form... New adventures pictured for us in the scientifiction of today are not at
                    all impossible of realization tomorrow... Many great science stories destined to be of historical
                    interest are still to be written... Posterity will point to them as having blazed a new trail, not
                    only in literature and fiction, but progress as well.</i>
        </p>

        <p>In 1928,<strong> E. E. "Doc" Smith</strong>'s first published work,<strong><i> The Skylark of
                    Space</i></strong>, written in collaboration with Lee Hawkins Garby, appeared in Amazing Stories. It
            is often called the first great space opera. The same year,<strong> Philip Francis Nowlan</strong>'s
            original Buck Rogers story,<strong><i> Armageddon 2419</i></strong>, also appeared in Amazing Stories. This
            was followed by a Buck Rogers comic strip, the first serious science fiction comic.</p>

        <p><strong><i>Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future</i></strong> is a "future history" science
            fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author<strong> Olaf Stapledon</strong>. A work of unprecedented
            scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years.
        </p>

        <p>In 1937,<strong> John W. Campbell</strong> became editor of<strong><i> Astounding Science
                    Fiction</i></strong>, an event that is sometimes considered the beginning of the Golden Age of
            Science Fiction, which was characterized by stories celebrating scientific achievement and progress. The
            "Golden Age" is often said to have ended in 1946, but sometimes the late 1940s and the 1950s are included.
        </p>

        <p>In 1942,<strong> Isaac Asimov</strong> started his<strong><i> Foundation</i></strong> series, which
            chronicles the rise and fall of galactic empires and introduced psychohistory. The series was later awarded
            a one-time Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series".<strong> Theodore Sturgeon</strong>'s<strong><i> More Than
                    Human </i>(1953)</strong> explored possible future human evolution. In 1957,<strong><i> Andromeda: A
                    Space-Age Tale</i></strong> by the Russian writer and paleontologist<strong> Ivan Yefremov</strong>
            presented a view of a future interstellar communist civilization and is considered one of the most important
            Soviet science fiction novels.
        </p>

        <p>In 1959,<strong> Robert A. Heinlein</strong>'s<strong><i> Starship Troopers</i></strong> marked a departure
            from his earlier juvenile stories and novels. It is one of the first and most influential examples of
            military science fiction, and introduced the concept of powered armor exoskeletons. The German space opera
            series<strong><i> Perry Rhodan</i></strong>, written by various authors, started in 1961 with an account of
            the first Moon landing and has since expanded in space to multiple universes, and in time by billions of
            years. It has become the most popular science fiction book series of all time.</p>

        <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, New Wave science fiction was known for its embrace of a high degree of
            experimentation, both in form and in content, and a highbrow and self-consciously "literary" or "artistic"
            sensibility.</p>

        <p>In 1961,<strong><i> Solaris</i></strong> by<strong> Stanisław Lem</strong> was published in Poland.[80] The
            novel dealt with the theme of human limitations as its characters attempted to study a seemingly intelligent
            ocean on a newly discovered planet. Lem's work anticipated the creation of microrobots and micromachinery,
            nanotechnology, smartdust, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence (including swarm intelligence), as
            well as developing the ideas of "necroevolution" and the creation of artificial worlds.</p>

        <p>In 1965,<strong><i> Dune</i></strong> by<strong> Frank Herbert</strong> featured a much more complex and
            detailed imagined future society than had previously in most science fiction. In 1967<strong> Anne
                McCaffrey</strong> began her<strong><i> Dragonriders of Pern</i></strong> science fantasy series. Two of
            the novellas included in the first novel,<strong><i> Dragonflight</i></strong>, made McCaffrey the first
            woman to win a Hugo or Nebula Award</p>

        <p>In 1968,<strong> Philip K. Dick</strong>'s<strong><i> Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i></strong> was
            published. It is the literary source of the<strong><i> Blade Runner</i></strong> movie franchise. In
            1969,<strong><i> The Left Hand of Darkness</i></strong> by<strong> Ursula K. Le Guin</strong> was set on a
            planet in which the inhabitants have no fixed gender. It is one of the most influential examples of social
            science fiction, feminist science fiction, and anthropological science fiction.</p>

        <p>In 1979,<strong><i> Science Fiction World</i></strong> began publication in the People's Republic of China.
            It dominates the Chinese science fiction magazine market, at one time claiming a circulation of 300,000
            copies per issue and an estimated 3–5 readers per copy (giving it a total estimated readership of at least 1
            million), making it the world's most popular science fiction periodical.</p>

        <p>In 1984,<strong>William Gibson</strong> 's first novel,<strong><i> Neuromancer</i></strong>, helped
            popularize cyberpunk and the word "cyberspace", a term he originally coined in his 1982 short
            story<strong><i> Burning Chrome</i></strong>. In the same year,<strong> Octavia Butler</strong>'s short
            story<strong><i> "Speech Sounds"</i></strong> won the Hugo Award for Short Story. She went on to explore in
            her work of racial injustice, global warming, women's rights, and political conflict. In 1995, she became
            the first science-fiction author to receive a MacArthur Fellowship. In 1986,<strong><i> Shards of
                    Honor</i></strong> by<strong> Lois McMaster Bujold</strong> began her<strong><i> Vorkosigan
                    Saga</i></strong>. 1992's<strong><i> Snow Crash</i></strong> by<strong> Neal Stephenson</strong>
            predicted immense social upheaval due to the information revolution.</p>

        <p>In 2007,<strong> Liu Cixin</strong>'s novel,<strong><i> The Three-Body Problem</i></strong>, was published in
            China. It was translated into English by<strong> Ken Liu</strong> and published by Tor Books in 2014, and
            won the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel, making Liu the first Asian writer to win the award.</p>

        <p>Emerging themes in late 20th and early 21st century science fiction include environmental issues, the
            implications of the Internet and the expanding information universe, questions about biotechnology,
            nanotechnology, and post-scarcity societies. Recent trends and subgenres include steampunk, biopunk, and
            mundane science fiction.</p>
